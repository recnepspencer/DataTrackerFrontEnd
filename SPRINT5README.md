# Overview

This code was designed to learn how to unit test angular services and components. It also tests the auth service, as well as the login, registration, and logout components. I wrote this software because I believe it is important to emphasize test driven development. I want to start developing the habit of writing tests as I write code. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I need to add the logout button

- I need to continue to separate the business logic from the components properly
- I need to get a better idea of how to properly mock services when testing components
